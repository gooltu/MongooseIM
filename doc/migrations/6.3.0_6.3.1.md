## Log Handler Configuration

The shell log handler in `app.config` should be renamed from `shell_log` to `default`.
Otherwise, there would be duplicate logs in the shell because of the [lager removal](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/pull/4393).

## CA Certificate Configuration

Providing a CA certificate file (`cacertfile` option) is now mandatory for s2s listeners if the `use_starttls` option is set to `required` or `required_trusted`.
Similarly, this requirement applies when `fast_tls` is configured with the `verify_mode` option set to `peer` or `selfsigned_peer`.

## Multiple owner option for MUC Light

A new configuration option `allow_multiple_owners` was added to MUC Light. It is disabled as default.
Enabling this option allows to have multiple "admin" users, while not giving more rights to room members.
