## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability please contact us at mongoose-im@erlang-solutions.com.

We will try to get back to you as quickly as we can, given that we are a relatively small, open-source team.
If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will try to patch it as soon as our resources allow.

We do not provide a bug bounty.

We proudly support the [Erlang Ecosystem Foundation](https://erlef.org/), which includes the [Security Working Group](https://erlef.org/wg/security).
